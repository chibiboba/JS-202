# Testing and Validation

1. Update your code.
2. Test the results in your browser.
3. Validate your HTML.
4. Validate your CSS.
5. **Check your page on other browsers.**
6. Go back to step 1.

Step 5 is new: different browsers and browser versions use different defaults for CSS styles and sometimes process HTML differently, which can lead to discrepancies when you view a site in another browser. 

- CSS resets (discussed later) and using the W3C validators help avoid these issues, but they don't prevent them. 

- As a rule, you should periodically check your pages in different browsers depending on which browsers your site intends to support. Checking for cross-browser issues is crucial if your app must work on phones, tablets, and older browsers. Check for cross-browser problems often; it can be hard to pin down the cause of a problem if you wait until the end of the project.

# What to Focus On

**CSS box model** describes the mechanism that browsers use to construct a web page from the seemingly unrelated HTML and CSS code. 

- The box model is probably the most crucial concept a web developer needs to understand; without it, you'll soon find yourself playing Whac-A-Mole. 
- Learn what to expect from the browser when it processes your HTML and CSS, and how that changes depending on the visual display model, box-sizing model, and the box properties. 
- Don't skim this lesson: read it several times until you're sure you understand the concepts.

### Vocabulary

You should be able to use the following terms properly when discussing the box model and how it works.

- the box model
  - box properties
    - width and height
    - padding and margins
    - borders
  - visual display models
    - `block`
    - `inline`
    - `inline-block`
  - box sizing model
    - `content-box`
    - `border-box`
- dimensions
  - absolute units
  - relative units

You should be familiar with the following terms, but you're not expected to discuss them in detail.

- container
- physical pixels
- CSS reference pixels

### Box Properties

- Every box has a width, height, padding, border, and margins; know the differences.
- Padding, borders, and margins have separate properties to set the left, right, top, and bottom of each element. You can use shortcut properties to specify all four sides at once.
- How does the visual display model interact with margins, borders, and padding?

### Visual Display Models

- Understand the differences between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`.
- Containers are almost always `block` elements, while non-containers are `inline`. When in doubt, check MDN.
- Don't try to memorize which HTML elements are `block` or `inline`.
- How and when can you change an element's visual display model?

### Box Sizing Models

- Understand the `content-box` and `border-box` sizing models.
- How and when can you change the box-sizing model for an element?

### Dimensions

- Know the differences between `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`, and `auto`.
- Understand why we need to talk about CSS reference pixels and physical pixels. Don't try to memorize the details, but understand the topic well enough that you won't be too surprised the first time you encounter the differences in the wild.
- Use `auto` margins to center block elements horizontally.

### HTML

Don't try to memorize any new HTML elements you meet in this lesson.

### CSS

Become comfortable with the CSS `display`, `box-sizing`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties. Memorize this list of properties so you can look up the details when needed.

### Try the Examples

Try all the code examples, but don't copy and paste them. Typing the code will help you develop that much desired "muscle memory" and help you remember the materials.

After trying the code examples, modify them to see what happens. You won't break anything but your pride.

### Using the Documentation

We will ask you several times in this lesson to use HTML elements and CSS properties and selectors that we don't explicitly present to you. We don't expect you to be or become an expert on these implicit topics. However, you should understand them enough to use them in the context presented. For instance, we may ask you to change the appearance of an ordered list; you don't have to know how to construct an ordered list, but you should be able to learn enough to apply a color, for example, to the text of the `<li>` elements inside the list.

Sometimes we'll give you a hint, and sometimes we won't. It's up to you to find the information you need. It may be challenging, but sources are readily available. Use this opportunity to learn how to search for it. It's how junior developers become senior developers.

### Study From The Summary

Spend time with the Summary at the end of this lesson. It reviews the topics and terminology you should master before moving on.
