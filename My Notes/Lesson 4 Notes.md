# Introduction

People are list-makers. We all use lists to track the groceries we want to buy, the little jobs and errands we need to get done, who to invite to a party, and more. Even our writing system and mathematics got their starts because of our desire to write lists. It's no surprise then that HTML provides list capabilities, and that the web is awash in them. What's unusual about HTML lists is how much power and flexibility you can access with a handful of HTML tags and list-centric CSS properties.

In addition to being list makers, people also seem to enjoy creating tables for data: multiplication tables, tax tables, sports standings, and so on. Of course, HTML provides a way to create tables; in fact, the `table` element and its child members combine in a startling variety of ways to produce almost any type of tabular structure that you need.

This lesson focuses initially on lists and how Web pages use them. While web pages don't use them nearly as often as images, you can still find them almost every place you look. It isn't always apparent that you're looking at a list. After a little experience, though, you'll be able to spot most HTML lists at a glance.

After discussing lists, we'll move on to tables. While they once were ubiquitous on the web, most developers use them less often today. Still, they remain an integral part of the HTML toolset.
