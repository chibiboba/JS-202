### Discussion

A description list would work best for the writers and books list, so choice **C** is best.

### Discussion

An unordered list would work best for a candidate list. In most cases, a candidate list should show the candidates in an arbitrary sequence, so you don't want to number them in any way. Thus, choice **A** is the most appropriate.

### Discussion

An unordered list works best for navigation lists. The order of the list is unimportant, and you don't need to use numeric ids with such a list. Thus, choice **A** is best.

### Discussion

An ordered list works well for top-10 type listings. You can even list them in reverse order if desired by using the `reversed` attribute on the `<ol>` tag. Choice **B** is best.

### Discussion

The word "table" gives this one away: you want to use a `<table>` element rather than one of the list elements. Thus, choice **D** is the most appropriate answer.

### Discussion

Don't use tables for layout purposes. Developers often did this in the early days of the Web, but we now have the tools to lay out pages without tables. Thus, choice **A** is incorrect. Choice **C** is false - tables can have a different number of cells in each row by using the `colspan` attribute. Choice **D** is also wrong since you won't want to use a table here. You do, however, want to consider using `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` when using tables elsewhere.

### Discussion

The correct way to style row and column headings separately is to use the `scope` attribute and an appropriate attribute selector. Using classes also works. Thus, **B** and **D** are correct.

Choice **C** is incorrect since you can, and probably will have multiple row and column headings and you can use any given ID only once on a page. Choice **A** is obviously incorrect since choices **B** and **D** are correct.
